# MULTI-TUBULAR MEMBRANE REACTOR

This program calculates the performance of a multi-tubular membrane reactor based on given parameters. The reactor consists of multiple tubes, and gas flows through these tubes while undergoing reactions and heat transfer.

## PARAMETERS:

* R: Gas constant [J/(mol K)]
* P_0: Inlet pressure [Pa]
* T_0: Inlet temperature [K]
* D_i: Inner diameter of tubes [m]
* L: Length of reactor [m]
* eps_bed: Bed void fraction
* eps_mem: Membrane porosity
* T_max: Maximum allowable temperature [K]

## CALCULATED PARAMETERS:

* A_i: Inner area of tubes [m^2]
* V_bed: Bed volume [m^3]
* V_void: Void volume [m^3]
* V_mem: Membrane volume [m^3]
* V_tot: Total volume [m^3]
* L_tube: Length of each tube [m]
* u_gas: Gas velocity [m/s]
* u_mem: Membrane velocity [m/s]

## LOOP VARIABLES:

* i: Loop variable for iterating through tubes
* x: Position in the tube [m]
* dx: Step size for position calculation [m]
* T: Temperature [K]
* P: Pressure [Pa]
* v_gas: Gas velocity in the tube [m/s]
* v_mem: Membrane velocity in the tube [m/s]
* u: Average velocity in the tube [m/s]
* u_diff: Difference between gas and membrane velocities [m/s]
* Re: Reynolds number
* f: Friction factor
* Nu: Nusselt number
* h: Convective heat transfer coefficient [W/(m^2 K)]
* q_conv: Heat transfer rate due to convective heat transfer [W]
* q_mem: Heat transfer rate through the membrane [W]
* q_rxn: Heat transfer rate due to reactions [W]
* dT_dx: Temperature gradient along the tube [K/m]


The program uses a numerical approach to calculate the temperature distribution, pressure drop, and heat transfer rates in each tube. The convective heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number, and friction factor are assumed to be constant throughout the tubes.

The program assumes constant properties of the gas and membrane, and does not consider any axial dispersion, radial effects, or variation in reaction rates along the tubes. The values for gas and membrane velocities (u_gas and u_mem) are example values and should be updated based on actual flow rates and membrane properties.

The output of this program can be used to evaluate the performance of a multi-tubular membrane reactor in terms of temperature profiles, pressure drops, and heat transfer rates, which can help in optimizing the design and operation of the reactor.
